# **Listing Disks and Partitions in an Azure Virtual Machine**  

## **Why Do DevOps and Cloud Engineers Need to Manage Disks?**  

In the **previous lesson**, we attached a **20GB disk (`/dev/sdb`)** to an **Azure Virtual Machine**. But before we can use it, we need to verify:  
- Is the system recognizing the disk?  
- Does the disk already have partitions?  
- What file system (if any) is present on the disk?  

As a **DevOps Engineer**, it is crucial to inspect storage before making changes to avoid accidental data loss.  

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:  
- List all attached disks and partitions in an Azure VM.  
- Check if a disk has existing partitions before formatting.  
- Retrieve information about storage devices using Linux tools.  
- Prepare a disk for partitioning and formatting if needed.

## **Step 1: List Available Disks in the Azure VM**  

After logging into your Azure VM via SSH, check the currently attached storage devices.  

### **1.1 Use `lsblk` to View Block Devices**  

```bash
lsblk
```
**Expected Output:**
```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0  30G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0  29G  0 part /
└─sda2   8:2    0   1G  0 part [SWAP]
sdb      8:16   0  20G  0 disk
```
### **Understanding the Output:**
- `sda` → The main OS disk (30GB).  
- `sda1` → The root partition (`/`).  
- `sda2` → The swap partition.  
- `sdb` → The 20GB disk we attached in the last lab (unpartitioned).

## **Step 2: Check Partition Details of the New Disk (`/dev/sdb`)**  

Before formatting a disk, we need to check if it has existing partitions.

### **2.1 Use `fdisk -l` to List Partition Information**  

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Disk /dev/sda: 30 GiB, 32212254720 bytes, 62914560 sectors
Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sda1  *     2048  62914559  62912512  29G 83 Linux
/dev/sda2       62914560 62926847  12288  1G 82 Linux swap

Disk /dev/sdb: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
```
### **What This Tells Us:**  
- `/dev/sda` has two partitions (`sda1` and `sda2`), which are being used.  
- `/dev/sdb` has no partitions yet (it is raw storage).  

Since `/dev/sdb` has no partitions, we can now prepare it for use.  

---

## **Step 3: Display Partition Information Using Other Tools**  

Different tools provide additional insights about disks and partitions.  

### **3.1 Check Partitions with `parted`**
```bash
sudo parted -l
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Model: Virtio Block Device (virtblk)
Disk /dev/sda: 30GB
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    File system     Name  Flags
 1      1049kB  30GB    30GB    ext4

Disk /dev/sdb: 20GB
Partition Table: unknown
```
Since `/dev/sdb` has no partition table, it means the disk is not yet prepared for use.  

---

### **3.2 Check Filesystem Information Using `blkid`**  
```bash
blkid
```
**Expected Output:**  
```
/dev/sda1: UUID="e1a3f8c5-5b34-4a62-bde7-ef75b8a6f8dc" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sda2: UUID="4f3c8f65-2f44-4d84-a5a8-2dcfbc5e52c3" TYPE="swap"
```
Since `/dev/sdb` is missing from this output, it means it has no filesystem yet.  

---

### **3.3 Check Disk Usage with `df -h`**
```bash
df -h
```
**Expected Output:**  
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       29G   10G   19G  34% /
```
Since `/dev/sdb` is not listed here, it is not yet mounted.  

---

## **Step 4: Summary & Next Steps**  

- We confirmed that `/dev/sdb` (20GB) is attached to the Azure VM.  
- It has no partitions, no file system, and is not mounted.  
- The disk is ready to be partitioned and formatted.  

---

## **Key Takeaways**  

- `lsblk` lists all block devices attached to the system.  
- `fdisk -l` shows partition details for each disk.  
- `parted -l` displays partition tables and filesystem types.  
- `blkid` retrieves filesystem UUIDs and types.  
- `df -h` displays mounted filesystems and disk usage.  

---

## **What’s Next?**  

Now that we have identified and verified the new disk, the next step is:  

- Partitioning and formatting the disk.  
- Creating an `ext4` or `xfs` filesystem.  
- Mounting the partition and ensuring it persists after reboot.  

Let’s move to the next lesson: **Creating and Formatting File Systems in an Azure VM**.
