# **Managing Users in Linux**

User management is an essential task for **system administrators and Cloud engineers**. It ensures proper access control, security, and efficient collaboration in a multi-user Linux environment.

---

## **1. Creating a User**

🔹 **Why Create Users?**

- Each user should have **separate credentials** to **enhance security**.
- Needed for **team collaboration on shared servers**.
- Best practice: **Don’t use root for daily tasks!**

✅ **Command to Create a New User**

```bash
sudo useradd clouduser
```

📌 This **creates a user** but does **not set a password**.

✅ **Set a Password for the User**

```bash
sudo passwd clouduser
```

📌 It will prompt for a **new password** for `clouduser`.

🔹 **Verify the User Creation**

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep clouduser
```

📌 The output shows the user’s details like **username, home directory, and shell**.

✅ **Example Use Case**\
**Scenario:** You want to **add a new Cloud engineer to the team** and give them access to the server.

```bash
sudo useradd devuser
sudo passwd devuser
```

📌 Now, `devuser` can log in with their password.

---

## **2. Deleting a User**

🔹 **Why Delete Users?**

- **Security measure** when an employee leaves.
- Prevent **unauthorized access** to critical systems.

✅ **Command to Delete a User**

```bash
sudo userdel devuser
```

📌 This **removes the user but keeps their home directory and files**.

✅ **Delete a User and Their Home Directory**

```bash
sudo userdel -r devuser
```

📌 The `-r` flag **removes the user’s home directory and files**.

✅ **Example Use Case**\
**Scenario:** A Cloud engineer resigns, and you need to remove their access:

```bash
sudo userdel -r devuser
```

📌 Now, `devuser` **cannot access the system** anymore.

---

## **3. Modifying a User**

🔹 **Why Modify Users?**

- To **change user privileges** or account settings.
- To **lock or unlock** user accounts temporarily.

✅ **Lock a User Account**

```bash
sudo usermod -L clouduser
```

📌 Prevents `clouduser` from logging in.

✅ **Unlock a User Account**

```bash
sudo usermod -U clouduser
```

📌 Allows `clouduser` to log in again.

✅ **Example Use Case**\
**Scenario:** You need to temporarily **disable an inactive user account**:

```bash
sudo usermod -L clouduser
```

📌 Now, `clouduser` **cannot log in** until unlocked.

---

## **4. Viewing User Information**

🔹 **Why Check User Details?**

- To confirm **which user is currently logged in**.
- To **view user permissions**.

✅ **Check the Current Logged-in User**

```bash
whoami
```

📌 Shows the **currently logged-in user**.

✅ **View User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID)**

```bash
id clouduser
```

📌 Displays **UID, GID, and group memberships**.

✅ **List All Users on the System**

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

📌 Shows all **user accounts** on the system.

✅ **Example Use Case**\
**Scenario:** You need to **check user details** before modifying account settings:

```bash
id clouduser
```

📌 This verifies **the user’s UID, GID, and groups**.

---

# **Key Takeaways**

✅ **Create a user** with `useradd` and **set a password** with `passwd`.\
✅ **Delete users** securely with `userdel -r`.\
✅ **Modify users** by locking/unlocking accounts.\
✅ **Check user details** with `whoami`, `id`, and `/etc/passwd`.
